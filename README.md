# WebClient chat App

We have created and designed a client side chat app.
This project was created with bootstrap, javaScript, css and html.

## Start

Runs the app with login.html file, then you will need to insert username and password.
You will get two options: Login or Register.

### Register

If you are not registered, you must first register in the registration form. 
Attention: You must fill in the details that appear on the form - properly,
otherwise you will receive warnings in the appropriate places!

### Login

To login successfully, please login with one of the users which you can find in allUsers.js file.
Attention: If you try to login with an unregistered user or incrorrct detail, you will get a warning!
 
#### Record option

To record a voice message, you have to press the record button (you will need to wait until it loads),
then press it again, confirm access to the microphone, then you can start talking.
When you want to stop, press the stop button and then you can listen to your recording.

#### Visibility

If the input bar on the conversation screen is not aligned,
please play with your screen size (decrease or increase) until a uniform appearance is obtained.
